plan a ui conversion project. Create a planning document in .antigravity/ui_inertia2_shadcn_react_plam.md. Iclude tasks like UI analysis, UI design, UI Component definition, UI Component implementeation, UI Component integratation (with existing RAILS APP), and final delivery. If there are steps wrong or missing,  tell me.  I want to use inertia 2.0, Shadcn components and react js
